At the University of Georgia, I wanted to find ways I could make money. During the week I work at the <b>Animal and Dairy Science Department</b>. 
It is with the University of Georgia and we cut and clean meats that are brought to us for studies.
I am also involved in a business fraternity named <b>Pi Sigma Epislon</b>.
This organization specializes in helping marketing, sales and management students find employment
post-graduation and helps them to build professionalism.Through this organization I've developed many conections and gotten
contacts for potential jobs. This fall, I recently joined <b>HEROs</b>. This club is based around helping children affected
and infected by HIV/AIDS. We were able to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to support these kids.</p>
<p>Finally,my favorite organization I joined four years <b> Sigma Chi </b>. The photo to the right is from our webasite I am a member of the
Delta chapter of Sigma Chi at the University of Georgia. Through this organization I
have found young men that have similar ambitions to me. Addtionally, my fraterinty is involved with
the philanthropy, <b>Recovery Dawgs Foundation</b>, in order to rally behind individuals seeking help from addiction.</p>
